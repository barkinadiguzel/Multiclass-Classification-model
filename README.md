#Multi-class Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple multi-class classification model using PyTorch.

Description

A synthetic dataset with 4 classes and 2 features is generated using sklearn.make_blobs.

A feedforward neural network with two hidden layers is trained on this dataset.

The model is trained using CrossEntropyLoss and SGD.

Decision boundaries are visualized for both the training and test sets.

Test accuracy is printed after training.
